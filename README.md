Project #2 in Software Design &amp; Implementation, Worked in a team of 3 to engineer an interactive GUI interface that displays multiple cell automata simulations.

Design document as well as all other java and necessary files are in file. Cloned from private repository from class project.


cellSociety_team03 - before changes: This is the functional software program before my team decided to try to implement design changes. See info on design changes below.

cellSociety_team03 - design changes: This is not fully functional (3 out of 4 simulations run) but demonstrates the design changes we wanted to implement. We wanted to replace Grid<Occupant> to Grid<Location>. This would allow the program to be more scalable for more complex cell automatas. Utilizing the Location class would give us the ability to give each grid location attributes.Therefore, rather than iterating through each occupant in the simluation, we could now iterate through each location which would allow the location to be dynamic as well.
